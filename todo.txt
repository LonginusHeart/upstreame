CODE
================================================================================
- Optimize drawing routine further to improve performance for ~ 800x500 canvas
  size
  * Look into blitting techniques from old console era
- Accomadate for variable frame rate:
  * Create globally accessible object, GameStats
  * Extend Base actor to take movement parameters for full 60fps
  * Add new Base#move that uses movement parameters and moves dependent upon
    framerate
  * Update all existing actors to use Base#move method when moving
- Add ParallaxViewport class, which automatically pans across backgrounds as
  screen moves
- Add Current class, representing ocean currents in game and pushing submersible
- Add zoom in/out method to pixelart page
- Add World class, which can be constructed as a grid of many different tiles
- Add WorldTile class, where subclasses represent objects such as
  SubmersibleTile denoting initial position of the submersible, or CoralTile
  denoting the position of coral based terain.
- Add leveleditor tool to quickly prototype levels


ART
================================================================================
- Background scenery
  * Multiple layers to take advantage of parallaxing viewport
  * Only one set needed, dynamic shading will add variation as game progresses
- Background Actors with Movement Animations
  * Sea creatures living near the surface:
    + Small pod of whales
- Foreground Actors with Movement Animations
  * Sea creatures living near the surface:
    + Sharks (two or three)
    + Jellyfish (two or three types)
    + Single fish (medium sized)
    + Sea turtle (two sizes)
    + Dolphins (two sizes)
    + Crab
- Forground Scenery:
  * Near surface:
    + Kelp clusters
    + Coral clusters
    + Rocks
    + Starfish
    + Shellfish
    + Octopus (resting)
    + Terrain
- Oceanic Forces
  * Current
    + Sketch concepts (maybe prototype with real world flip book?)
